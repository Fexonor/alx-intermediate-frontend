Install Anywhere (npm)
If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running

# npm install -g sass

However, please note that this will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower than the other options listed here. But it has the same interface, so itâ€™ll be easy to swap in another implementation later if you need a bit more speed!
